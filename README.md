This project aims to use Machine Learning and data science in order to understand what makes wine taste the way it tastes.

The intention to create this project is to gain knowledge and practical experience in the field of Data Science.

The aim is to extract and interpolate data from the .csv files and get insights into what makes a specific wine taste the way it does.
Then use that extraplated information to train a Machine Learning model that would detect what makes a wine tastes "good".



The dataset I've used is the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository.
This dataset has two sets of wine data, one for red wine and one for white wine.
The wines used int his data set were produced at Vinho Verde,, a region in the north of Portugal.
